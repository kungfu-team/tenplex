# Reconfiguration Horovod

We also compare Tenplexâ€™s overhead to Horovod, a distributed training library without elasticity support, and Horovod-Elastic, which also supports scaling under data parallelism only by periodically checkpointing the model state. We deploy a ResNet50 model with the ImageNet dataset in the on-premise cluster, and measure throughput when training on 2 GPUs.
