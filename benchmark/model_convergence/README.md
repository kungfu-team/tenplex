# Model convergence
_Fig. 16. Model convergence with reconfiguration_

We evaluate Tenplexâ€™s impact on model convergence. For this, we use the BERT-large model with the OpenWeb-Text dataset deployed on the on-premise cluster. At training step 100, we either increase or decrease the resources and compare them to a baseline without change.
